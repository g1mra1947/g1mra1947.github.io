<div>We run models powered by on-board batteries, by track-supplied current and by live steam with boilers fired by alcohol, gas or coal. Even clockwork engines still make occasional appearances. You can read about the breadth of activity within G1MRA by downloading these copies of our welcome brochure and a sample of our quarterly magazine</div>
